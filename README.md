# MA677_G-S-311-example
In Chapter 2 of G&S, Example 3.11 uses the binomial distribution to demonstrate the logic of hypothesis testing with a simple example.In the final paragraph of the example on page 102, the authors write, ”A few experiments have shown us that ... ”. They report the results but don’t show you their experiments. Similarly, they show you Figure 3.7, but not how it was produced.

The goal of this assignment is to fill these gaps and give explanation of the example showing how the authors reached their conclusion that the critical value should be between 69 and 73 people cured and explain Figure 3.7.
